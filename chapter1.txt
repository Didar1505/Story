The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, squinted against the relentless spray, his weathered hands gripping the cold metal railing. For fifty years, the beam had been his constant companion, a silent promise against the churning sea. Tonight, however, the fog was a suffocating blanket, thicker than any he'd seen, swallowing the light almost as soon as it left the lens tower. He heard the distant, mournful groan of a foghorn â€“ a freighter, lost and dangerously close. With a grunt, Silas descended the winding stairs, his boots echoing in the stone cylinder, to manually crank the ancient, deafening foghorn within the lighthouse base, its bellowing reply a desperate, necessary intrusion into the eerie silence, a guiding voice piercing the grey veil where the light could not reach.
